# data/

**N.B.** [padloc](https://github.com/leightonpayne/padloc) ships with an empty  `data/` directory. These files need to be download from [padlocDB](https://github.com/leightonpayne/padlocDB) where they are maintained and updated separately:

1. Clone repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leightonpayne/padlocDB
```

2. Compile database (include path to padloc to automatically move files):

```bash
./db-compile.sh "path/to/padloc" # e.g. "~/tools/padloc"
```
