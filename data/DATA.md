# data/

`padloc` ships with an empty  `data/` directory. These files need to be download from `padlocDB` where they are maintained and updated separately:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leightonpayne/padlocDB
```

Move or copy files into `data/`:

```bash
mv path/to/padlocDB/* path/to/padloc/data/
```
